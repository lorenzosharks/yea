        <p>The USSR is a Eurasian superstate that began from 1922</p>
        <p>It has survived the Nazi attack and held Leninsgrad fro 4 brutal years</p>
        <p>The will of the Soviet people has stood in the darkest of times, resisting the dark grips of capitalism and nazism</p>
        <p>We have the strongest intelligence agency in the world, the Комитет государственной безопасности.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the USSR was the first to space and the first to build an ICBM.</p>
        <p>We have won all of our wars such as Vietnam and the Korean War.</p>
        <p>During the Great Depression, our economy stood up unlike the weak American capitalist economy.</p>
