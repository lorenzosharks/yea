        <h3>3 Processes of Translation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Initiation</li>
            <li>Elongation</li>

        <p>Transcription is the process of RNA being read and converted to a polypeptide chain of proteins. First, there are several major factors.</p>

        <h3>Initiation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The smallest subunit of the ribosome attaches to the 5' cap</li>
            <li>The large subunit then attaches to the small subunit which forms an entire ribosome</li>
            <li>The ribosome moves along until it finds the AUG codon</li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
        <h3>Elongation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>A tRNA with an anticodon that matches the AUG codon flies into the A-Site</li>
            <li>The ribosome takes the amino acid on the end of the tRNA and holds it</li>
            <li>The first tRNA goes to the P-Site and the ribosome moves on to the next 3 RNA nucleotides</li>
            <li>A tRNA with that anticodon goes into the A-Site</li>
            <li>The ribosome takes the amino acid of the new tRNA and attaches it to the one it is holding</li>
            <li>The AUG anticodon tRNA goes out of the ribosome to get a new amino acid</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, the new tRNA that just came in goes to the P-site and the ribosome reads the next three RNA nucleotide</li>
            <li>This eventaully creates a long chain of polypeptide which is the primary structure of a protein</li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
        <h3>Termination</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>After reading through the mRNA, the ribosome encounters a release factor</li>
            <li>The release factor tells the ribosome to stop translating and pulling tRNAs (IMPORTANT NOTE: The release factor does not have an amino acid associated with it and thus does not get translated)</li>
            <li>Both subunits of the ribosome falls off and goes to find another mRNA</li>
        </ol>
        <hr>
        <p>And the the protein folds while the mRNA is broken down by enzymes and reused in the nucleus.</p>
