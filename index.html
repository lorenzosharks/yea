        <b style="font-size: 100ch;">Big Larry</b>
        <p>Long before time had a name,
The first gods sprang to life. Those gods were fools, knowing
nothing but kindness and love. However, another god also existed.
He was full of war and destruction. However, he was still a child,
overshadowed by the other gods. He slumbered for 100,000 millenias,
waiting, biding his time to rise. His name is Big Larry.</p>
